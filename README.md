# docker-groimp-jdk8

## This is a general Docker container to run GroIMP 1.6 with java 1.8. It can be map to the folder structure of the model with docker-compose file

#### due to Oracle authentication requirement, user need to download the java version by themselves and put into the java folder before running the docker build

## a general workflow for using this docker file is use it as the groimp application, write docker-compose script to map the model, and run the model from a docker compose file
